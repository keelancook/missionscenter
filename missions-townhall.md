Join us again Tuesday evening for a missions townhall where you will have the opportunity to listen to and interact with our missionary panel. Ask questions concerning the missionary task, particular peoples or cultures in their field of service, or life on the field. This event is not just for our on-campus students. A livestream of the event will incorporate distance students as well and even allow them an opportunity to interact with our missionaries.

**Time:** 7pm
**Location:** Eitel Auditorium
*Free dinner provided*
