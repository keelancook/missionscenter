## Summary
In *Created in God’s Image*, Anthony Hoekema sets out a full-formed doctrine of humanity concerning both its “nature and destiny” (7). In order to do so, Hoekema engages the biblical material and interacts with relevant theories across a number of theological positions landing on a Reformed understanding of the doctrine. As with any doctrine of humanity, Hoekema’s is centrally concerned with the image of God. His view is composite, claiming that the image of God has both structural and functional dimensions. Hoekema demonstrates this understanding as it plays out in three relationships: (1) humans to God, (2) humans to other humans, and (3) humans to the rest of creation. As do others, he notes that the image is affected by the fall and by redemption essentially existing in four stages throughout history: (1) the pre-fall image, (2) the fallen image, (3) the renewed image, and ultimately (4) the perfected image.

### Summary of Chapter One
In order to introduce his topic, Hoekema notes a renewal of urgency around the questions of anthropology. With a dizzying array of philosophies in the public square, a robust treatment of the biblical understanding of man is needed. Hoekema calls for a line between both the idealistic and the materialistic anthropologies that dominate the landscape and a distinctly Christian understanding of humanity. In chapter 1, Hoekema claims this work will develop a such and understanding, distinguish it from other views of humanity, and then develop implications. Hoekema also notes that it is imperative to notice the areas where non-Christian views have impacted various Christian anthropologies (15).

### Summary of Chapter Two
Hoekema’s primary purpose in chapter 2 is demonstrating the paradox in the biblical view of man as created person. He writes,“The human being is both a creature and a person; he or she is a created person. This, now, is the central mystery of man: how can man be both a creature and a person at the same time” (17)? This plays a role in justification and sanctification. “Since man is a creature, God must regenerate him—give him new spiritual life. Since man is also a person, however, he or she must also believe—that is, in response to the gospel, he or she must make a conscious, personal choice to accept Christ and follow him,” continues Hoekema, “These two, regeneration and faith, must always be seen together” (20).

### The Image of God: Chapters 3-5
Surveying the biblical data on the imago Dei, first in the Old Testament and then the New Testament , Hoekema comes to three conclusions: (1) despite the fall, man still bears the image of God, (2) but something has been diminished and marred (or lost) of the imago Dei, and (3) there will be a time when the total imago Dei is restored as we will become like Christ in a fuller sense. The fall did not obliterate the complete image of God. Salvation and sanctification progressively restore the image. The New Testament develops the idea of the image as conforming to the image of Christ, who is the perfect image of God.

Hoekema traces the historical development of the doctrine in chapter 4, evaluating the views that developed. He starts with Irenaeus and treats various views to the beginning of the twentieth century. Notably, he draws out the insistence on reason and rationality that developed early through Greek influence and persisted until the Reformation. Calvin, for Hoekema, appears to be a major step forward. He is critical of Barth and impressed with the dynamic, relationship focus of Berkouwer. Hoekema further develops the significant role of relationship interred in the image in his own view.

In chapter 5, Hoekema provides a theological summary of the doctrine. The image of God is not something humans posses, according to Hoekema, but an essential characteristic. Humans do not merely have the image, they are the image of God. In this sense, Hoekema claims that humans serve as a mirror and representative of God on earth. As opposed to unhelpful dichotomies or trichotomies, Hoekema asserts a wholistic understanding that includes the physical body. It also possesses broad and narrow aspect. Hoekema claims the functions of the image of primary, according to the Scriptures. Furthermore, he points to the importance of human relationships with God, themselves, and creation. These relationships, like the image itself, were affected by the fall and are once again affected by redemption, ultimately to be perfected in the new creation.

### Summary for Chapter Six
According to Hoekema, the relationship one has to themselves should not be included in the relationships connected to the image of God. “It is, rather, a relationship that underlies all the others, and makes possible a person’s proper performance in his or her relationships toward God, others, and nature,” writes Hoekema (147). In order to develop this idea of self-image, he compares and contrasts the ideas of self-esteem and self-love. Both of these ideas, according to Hoekema are problematic. Instead, he uses the term self-image to denote this relationship to oneself. He furthers the argument by claiming there are two ways in which the fall tends to pervert this image: (1) it can be overly elevated (you shall become like God) or (2) overly deflated (they were naked and ashamed). Redemption give the real meaning to positive self-image in humility as a new creation.

### Doctrine of Sin (Chapters 7-10)
Concerning the entrance of sin, Hoekema says the angels sinned first and that the Genesis narrative most likely gives us the literal story of humanity’s fall. He convincingly insists on the necessity of a literal Adam and asserts that sin is still a mystery. (132) For a robust doctrine of man, it is necessary that Adam is representative of all humanity, that he was given this initial command, and that his disobedience to this command brought about sin and death. It is precisely this that makes him a type of Christ, although a failed type (121).

In Chapter 8, Hoekema considers the spread of sin. Immediately, he notes that sin disappointment, shame, fear, and an evasion of responsibility (133). Sin instituted pervasive depravity that (1) extends to every facet of human nature and (2) removes love of God as a motivating factor. Hoekema then surveys four different views of sin’s transmission: (1) the Pelagian view, that there is no connection between Adam’s sin and the sins of subsequent humans, (2) mediate imputation, which claims sin transfer indirectly through the current state of corruption, (3) realism, which claims that the entire nature of humanity was present in Adam and has been divided among each subsequent human, and (4) immediate (direct) imputation, which claims there is no mediator for the guilt. Hoekema discounts the first two theories and blends the last two for his personal stance.

In his develop of the doctrine of sin, Hoekema promotes an understanding of common grace. He notes that a robust doctrine of sin certainly leads to a grim view of creation in its current state. In fact, it would cause one to wonder why there is still a creation at all in light of humanity’s pervasive evil. How has the human race not destroyed itself? This, of course, set the stage for Hoekema’s discussion of common grace and restraint of sin. Several factors play into sin’s restraint. First, is the concept of general revelation, which forces a general conformity to God’s laws on humanity. The penalties of governments and influence of social pressure serve as other restraints. Finally, Hoekema asserts that the cultural works of man now will carry over into the new heavens and new earth. This doctrine places meaning on the endeavors of Christians in society and places emphasis on working for a better world.

### Summary of Chapter Eleven
As noted earlier, Hoekema refutes trichotomous and dichotomous views of the person in favor of a unified whole. He notes distinctions between soul/spirit and body but that there is essential unity. This unity he calls a psychosomatic unity. He believes this unity is interrupted during an intermediate state where believers exist as disembodied until their resurrection, refuting soul sleep. He also claims this unity should have broad implications for life and ministry. Pastoral care, teaching, medicine, counseling are specifics he mentions.

### Summary of Chapter Twelve
Hoekema considers freedom, will, and human responsibility. Man has choice, but he says freewill is a problematic term. Hoekema uses the term “true freedom” as the ability to choose to obey God’s laws. Man had this before the fall, lost it after the fall, and progressively regains it in redemption. One day, man will have perfect freedom. (243)

## Evaluation
Hoekema’s chief contribution in this work is his development of doctrine concerning the imago Dei. A very helpful section, this explanation evaluates biblical teaching, historical development, and theological construction that results in a formative understanding. A strength if his view is that it does not boil the image down to a list of creative characteristics, option for a more essential understanding. Nevertheless, it is ultimately structural and functional. While Hoekema’s attempt is good, Hammett further refines this idea and reverses the order of priority, making the image primarily structural (a capacity for relationship) and secondarily functional (seeing relationship more as a result of the image). That is a helpful nuance. Concerning sin, common grace, and other aspects of theological anthropology, Hoekema appears to take a classic Reformed stance. He carefully develops clear views on each of these issues, and rarely does he seem to waiver from a traditional Reformed position.

Of particular importance is Hoekema’s focus on the New Testament understanding of the image as conforming to Christ. Rightly, Hoekema traces the connections between Christology and the imago Dei. That Christ is the perfect image of God is a repeated refrain in the texts of the New Testament. He is, in all ways, the fulfillment of the image of God in man. As the perfect man, he is the perfect image bearer. In such, to conform to the image of Christ is a call to correctly bear the image of God. Hoekema’s development of this truth is perhaps the most helpful section of the books.

As a text for missions, this work has value in developing understandings of sin, fallenness, and its effects on social structures. In addition, this work provides an encouraging word concerning human dignity and humanity’s need for the gospel. These ideas are all foundational to a healthy theology of mission.
