Please pray for Christians in the state of Zamfara, Nigeria, who have received a direct threat against their churches from local bandits. As the security situation in northwestern Nigeria continues to worsen, there are more frequent stories of violence against villages or camps of displaced peoples. Pray for security across the country and ask that the Lord to give peace to the believers as they shine brightly for Him during persecution.
