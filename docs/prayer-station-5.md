IMB missionaries in West Africa ask: “Please pray for us as we put together a team of West Africans who will do research among the Fulanke (pronounced foo-LAHN-kay) people this month. Ask the Lord to reveal to us two young men in the city who are mature in the faith and who have a desire to go into the unreached areas not only to do research, but also to proclaim peace, heal the sick, and proclaim the message of the kingdom of God all along the way. Also ask the Lord to place a burden for the salvation of the Fulanke on the hearts of two believers in the region and pray that they will be willing not only to host these two young men who come, but also travel with them two by two to every village where the Fulanke live. Pray that they will understand the mission and be motivated by love and obedience for the Lord. ‘After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go’ (Luke 10:1 ESV).”
