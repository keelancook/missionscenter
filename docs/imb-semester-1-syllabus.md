## Writing & Other Requirements
All writing assignments should be typed with the following formatting: 12-pt Times New Roman font, double-spaced, 1” margins, page numbers included, and bibliography (when necessary). Please include your name, the date, the course title, and the assignment at the top of the first page.

1. Scripture Study & Memorization – Before each class meeting, everyone should read, reflect on, and memorize a portion of 1 Timothy as laid out in the Course Schedule. Come with at least one discussion question related to pastoral ministry based on the passage studied that week.
2. Book Reading, Responses & Discussion – (a) Everyone should read all textbooks and other resources with reasonable care by the date indicated in the Course Schedule and come prepared to participate in group discussion.
   * You will write one book response for a book or book section on the required reading list (these are assigned on the course schedule, below). Book responses are different than book reviews. These papers should be 2-3 pages in length (4-5 pages if taking for credit) and are to summarize the key principles of the book and make personal application to ministry. Do not simply write a survey of the book.
   * Please paste the following four questions into your paper as the underlined headings within your paper and then place your response under each. You may write in first person language. The first and third questions should have the most content:
1. List 5-6 key principles in this reading. (State the first principle in a concise single sentence and then expand on it with further insights. Then state the next principle, etc.)
2. Was there anything you disagreed with or questioned? If so, what? (Limit yourself to a paragraph or two. Be fair and gracious in your critique.)
3. What were the most significant personal applications/challenges you learned for your own life and ministry from this reading? (Be specific, personal, and practical.)
4. Two questions that I have for discussion with the class after reading this book.
[3] Position Papers – You will write one position paper (3-4 pages; 4-5 pages if taking for credit) on an assigned ministry topic or situation. This paper will be the result of Bible study and research, and it should represent your personal position on the topic. The paper should be organized by a list of biblical principles that explain your position. Both the Bible and other research should be cited.
Each week the class will consider one ministry topic, issue, or situation. One or more Aspire participants will be assigned to write a position paper on that week’s topic (independently of one another). These papers should be emailed to the entire cohort and pastors by the Saturday before class.
In our Aspire meeting, the whoever was assigned to write on that week’s topic will present their position briefly (5 mins or less) and be prepared to lead the discussion and answer questions related to the topic. Everyone else should read the position papers before the Aspire meeting on Monday and come prepared to engage the topic with questions, observations, objections, etc.
Topics will be assigned and indicated in the course schedule, below.
[4] Philosophy of Ministry Essay – SEBTS students taking this course for credit should compose a Philosophy of Pastoral Ministry essay (4-5 pages) as a final document for the course. The essay must answer the following questions from a biblical, theological, and practical perspective:
What is a pastor?
What does a pastor do?
NOTE: This assignment must be submitted to the instructor AND via the Moodle Page for this course (the student is automatically enrolled to this Moodle Page) by the date set in the course calendar. The assignment upload portal will be labeled according to the academic year as follows: PA XX-XX Philosophy of Pastoral Ministry Essay.
