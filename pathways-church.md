We are currently developing the web resources for onboarding churches into the Sending Pathways initiative. Soon, we hope to provide churches with a clear way to assess their church's current practices related to sending, craft a custom plan for developing a robust sending culture within their congregation, and implement new processes to center their church around this mission.

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://ubahouston.org).
