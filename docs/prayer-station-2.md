Recently Fulani believers from rural areas gathered for a few days of foundational teaching. At this meeting, there were Fulani who were newer believers who hadnâ€™t yet been baptized, so it became a wonderful celebration of baptism and communion with the whole group. Now there are 15 more new Fulani believers in the rural areas wanting to be baptized. Give thanks for the way God is moving among the Fulani of western Niger! Celebrate these new lives in Christ and pray for them to grow in faith and understanding.
