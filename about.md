title: About Global Missions Week

---
Global Missions Week is a long tradition at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Southeastern truly is the Great Commission seminary, and each year, we spend a week dedicated to celebrating God's work among the nations and challenging all of our students to answer the question: Where am I going?

Global Missions Week is a campus-wide endeavor lead by the Center for Great Commission Studies that includes many different departments across campus. Over the course of the week, students experience chapel sermons, corporate worship and prayer, in-class lectures by missionaries, and several other events designed to equip students with a better understanding of global missions and encourage them to find their own pathway to the nations.
