“In the heart of a Kampala slum stands a brothel. It has trapped many women in the sex-trade industry, and they have been left broken and hopeless”. “However, God moved in the hearts of an IMB journeyman and her Ugandan partners. They faithfully sat outside this dark establishment and shared the love of Christ with the women week after week. Eventually, they were able to set up a Bible study and prayed for five of the women to come. That day, the first day of the Bible study, more than 50 women arrived to hear God’s Word! Since then, many have come to faith. Please pray that God will provide a way of escape from this lifestyle and that He will continue to bring many of the women to Himself.”
