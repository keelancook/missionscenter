We know you came because you care about the Great Commission. Coming to Southeastern is an important step in your ministry preparation, wherever that may lead. You came to Southeastern so that you can go to the ends of the earth. It just so happens, it's our job to help you find that pathway to the Great
Commission. In fact everyone at Southeastern is challened to answer the question:
# WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

Schedule a **GO meeting** today, and let us help you get there.

The **Center for Great Commission Studies** exists to help you discern how and where you will make disciples from Atlanta to Zimbabwe and everywhere in between. Whether it's international missions, planting or replanting a church, serving faithfully in pastoral ministry, or another way of fulfilling the Great Commission, our job is to help you put your feet on the path.

That's why we're offering you a **free cup of coffee** to sit down with one of the directors in the CGCS so that we can meet you and help
you begin finding your pathway to the Great Commission. To schedule your GO Meeting and grab that free cup of joe, use the QR code below and fill out the form online.
