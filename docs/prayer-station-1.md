Jake and Ginger Goss, IMB missionaries in Maseru, Lesotho, have engaged a village where Ginger leads a women’s discipleship group in a small church of 10 to 15 people. The pastor of this church recently visited a nearby village. The people of that village requested assistance from Jake and Ginger. The people explained that they were having trouble with the “tokolosi.” The Basotho deeply fear these evil spirits, which many times afflict them at night. Please pray for God to prepare hearts in this village to respond to the true gospel and for the people to experience a deep relationship with Jesus, completely void of the paralyzing fear with which they currently live. Pray for the pastor and Jake, as well as Ginger and their daughter, as they visit the village and tell of God’s power over the darkness. Also pray that Jake and the pastor will have wisdom concerning the most appropriate manner to approach this fearful group of people.
