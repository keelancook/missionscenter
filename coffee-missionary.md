Have you ever had coffee with a missionary? Today is your day, and they'll even buy the coffee. Head to the Ledford Student Center on Thursday during the posted times and have some one-on-one coffee and conversation. Our missionaries want to meet you and share more about their work and answer any questions you may have. If you are considering a call to international missions, or if you only want to know more about missions so you can be a better pastor or church member, this time is for you.

**Time:** 8-10am and 1-3pm

**Location:** Ledford Student Center
